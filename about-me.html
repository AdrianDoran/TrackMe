            Hello there,
            <br>As you can see from above my name is Adrian Doran.
            <br>My hobbies and passions that this time is creating Sci-Fi movie characters.
            <br>I am currently starting a new project which will endeavour to build Johnny Five from Short Circuit, but I am still in the process of doing something smaller like Wall-E or BB-9e from Star Wars.
            <br>The skills I have for this class is a basic knowledge in embedded systems, C++ and C#. I barely know Python but quickly learning the language.
            <br>The programming language I understand the most is HTML because i have been learning it ever since I was 12yo in 2001. Hopefully my skills can be put to good use in this unit.
            <br>The grade I am aiming for this unit is a Distiction. 'Why?' you ask. Well it's beacuse I want to always push my knowledge and learn more.
